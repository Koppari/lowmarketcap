# LowMarketCap



## About

LowMarketCap lets the user track cryptocurrencies with low market capitalizations. The aim is to provide a smooth searching experience for anyone who wants to easily look up relevant information on a promising blockchain project.

## Planned features

* Listing coins and tokens with easy filtering to only show low market cap ones.
* By default shows all coins, will have useful preset filters above the list.
* Either a paginated search or search based on filtering a search bar that happens on one page.
* Social media mentions for currencies.
    * First implementation for Reddit.
* Filtering, this needs to be better than CoinMarketCap.
* ICO info.
